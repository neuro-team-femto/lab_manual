To this aim, the project introduced several novel methodologies to study the effect of sound on the brain, in the form of acoustic transformation software (SMILE; DAVID, 2800 downloads as of Jan 2021; CLEESE, 950 downloads; ANGUS, 1200 downloads). These technologies formed the basis of experimental research articles notably published in PNAS (2016; 2018), Current Biology (2018; 2021) and Nature Communications (2021).</p> <p>Over the course of the project (2014-2020), the CREAM team employed more than 15 PhD-level scientists, roughly half of them coming from a computer science or audio engineering background, and the other half from a psychology or cognitive neuroscience background - a diverse, amazing crew of young scientists which have since the end of the project moved on, several of them to start their own independent positions. Beyond academia, the software technologies produced in the project have also been transfered to the voice technology startup Alta Voce, which is now testing the impact of real-time voice transformation in the field of customer relation.</p> <p>The CREAM team/project ended in December 2020.

So, if timing permits, you may want to wait for your approved ZRR application before e.g. paying Visa fees, booking tickets or incurring any costs (e.g. moving) because we wouldn't be able to reimburse theses costs if your ZRR application is declined.  </p>"},{"location":"being-a-lab-member/roles-and-expectations/","title":"Roles and expectations","text":""},{"location":"being-a-lab-member/roles-and-expectations/#big-picture","title":"Big Picture","text":"<p>Science is hard. But it\u2019s also fun. In the Neuro group, we want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding lab environment. To maintain that environment, we expect each other to:</p> <ul> <li>Do work we are proud of individually and as a group: Work on what you\u2019re passionate about, work hard at it, and be proud of it. Be so proud of it that you have to suppress giggling when you think about it (but it\u2019s still ok to giggle a little).</li> <li>Double-check our work, and be at least a little obsessive: Don\u2019t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. It\u2019s ok to make mistakes, but mistakes shouldn\u2019t be because of carelessness or rushed work. One useful rule of thumb is \"do I understand this at 130%\" ?</li> <li>Be supportive - we're all in this together: Support your fellow lab-mates. Help them out if they need help (even if you aren\u2019t on the project), and let them vent when they need to. Science is collaborative, not competitive. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it. In your own work, be independent when possible, but do ask for help when necessary.</li> <li>Be honest in your science: We all want to get papers published and do great things. But we do this honestly. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. If you make a mistake, you should immediately tell your collaborators (if they have already seen the results, and especially if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.</li> <li>Respect each other\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs. Respect your fellow lab-mates. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their differences, their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation.</li> <li>Keep everything awesome: If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. We can\u2019t thrive in an environment we aren\u2019t comfortable in, and disrespect or rudeness will not be tolerated in the lab.

If you aren\u2019t comfortable, then tell a senior member of the group (for smaller issues) or another member of the department (for more serious issues).</li> <li>Care your for health and happiness: Realize that for most of us, there are times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine. If you\u2019re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell your PI !). Your health and happiness come first. The lab looks out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help.

# Time management

* Annual structure \[How does a year look in the lab? How does term-time differ from vacation time? What happens to lab meetings etc during e.g. summer break? Are there key annual events that require attendance?]
* Leave/ holidays \[how many days of annual leave, is it okay to take most of your annual leave at once, sick leave guidelines, maternity leave, compassionate leave; whom to report leave to, e.g., secretary/ official or PI]
* Lab hours \[when to be in the lab for different roles; when is the lab room open]
* Absences \[when members are not in the lab, how to communicate leaves]
* Weekly/regular meetings \[time, place, purpose, journal club readings + link to schedule]
* Dealing with deadlines \[how to plan the completion of deadlines, how to deal with delays]
* In-lab and remote working norms \[when are members expected to work in the lab or how can they work from home]
* Calendar usage \[who to share your calendar with, what to put in your calendar]
* Social and special events \[if lab dinners/excursions/team-building/etc. is a part of lab life, or if it isnâ€™t, mention it here, social events]

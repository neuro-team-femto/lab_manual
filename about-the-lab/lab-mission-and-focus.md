# Lab mission & focus

Weâ€™re an interdisciplinary group of scientists exploring [control-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control\_theory) approaches to the analysis of human sensory electrophysiology.&#x20;

The brain is a real-time dynamical system. Yet, [clinical neurophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical\_neurophysiology) (and, in truth, much of cognitive neuroscience, from [ERPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-related\_potential) to [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional\_magnetic\_resonance\_imaging)) mostly treats it as a static averaging machine, which behavior is analysed and diagnosed from its averaged response over trials rather than from its real-time, single-trial variance.&#x20;

_Our vision is to create a control-systems revolution in human clinical neurophysiology_, by bringing to patients automatized stimulation techniques that are able to adapt in real time to their brain dynamics in order to diagnose, prognose and treat neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Our work is both experimental (we collect our own data, using tools borrowed from the fields of [electrophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) and [psychophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics)) and computational (we build our own software methods to generate experimental stimuli using [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech\_synthesis) and analyse physiological recordings using data-driven [system modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System\_identification)). We work both with healthy participants and patients, but our primary focus is to create the next generation of clinical methods in the fields of [neurology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology) and [psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry) for pathologies such as coma, stroke, autism spectrum and post-traumatic stress disorders.

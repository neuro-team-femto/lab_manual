## Orientation in Supmicrotech/ENSMM

The lab is hosted in the Supmicrotech (prev. known as ENSMM - pronounced enn-sem) building, which hosts 3 FEMTO-ST departments: AS2M (French: Automatique et Systèmes Micromécatroniques; English: Automation & Robotics); TF (French: Temps-Fréquence; English: Time-Frequency); DMA (French: Département de Mécanique Appliquée; English: Applied mechanics); as well as a teaching space for a relatively large _école d'ingénieur_ (Engineering grad school _ENSMM_ for _École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques_, now rebranded as Supmicrotech: [https://www.supmicrotech.fr/](https://www.supmicrotech.fr/)) and a variety of associated administrative services. A map of the ENSMM building can be found here <mark style="background-color:yellow;">XXX.</mark>

**Room numbering** in ENSMM is confusing, as it obeys to a 3D coordinate system ordered as height; length; width. Our common lab space 0.60.20 is on the ground floor (0), down the hall from the ENSMM main entrance (about 60 meters, probably), and not very far away from the front glassed part of the building (indeed, we directly face it). Our EEG room is one room further orthogonally from the front facade, and logically goes by 0.60.21. A room like 0.77.16 (seminar room Transfert #3, see below) you can infer is on the same floor (Ground floor 0), further away from main entrance (77, indeed in the neighboring "Transfert" building) and further on the right than the lab (towards the car park). Sounded like a good idea - but in practice nobody ever remembers the coordinate system and we address rooms by names.&#x20;

## Meeting rooms

If you need more space or privacy for meetings that what our common lab space can accomodate, the department has a number of rooms that can be booked via the FEMTO-ST room reservation web service ([https://booked.femto-st.fr](https://booked.femto-st.fr)).&#x20;

**Recommended meeting spaces** are:&#x20;

* AS2M meeting room (<mark style="background-color:yellow;">room XXX</mark>, next to Isabelle & Estelle's). Good for 4-6 people, has projector & white board. That's your easiest option.&#x20;
* TF meeting room (<mark style="background-color:yellow;">room XXX</mark>) : slightly larger, projector & white board. The neighboring TF (Temps-fréquence) dept. meeting room, which we are allowed to use occasionally
* Transfer #2 (room 0.73.16, Transfert building). Good for 10-15 people, has a projector and a large white board, relatively pleasing even for one-to-one brainstorm on the white board. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Rooms in Transfert building cannot be booked by the FEMTO room reservation service, but by email to accueil@ens2m.fr (alternatively, go and chat to the person at the ENSMM reception to ask for room availability)
{% endhint %}

**Recommended rooms for seminars**:&#x20;

* Amphi / salle Transfert 3 (room 0.77.16, in neighboring "Transfert" building). A large classroom (30-40 ppl) with a speaker stand and plateform. Suitable for small seminars.&#x20;
* Amphi Jules Haag (room <mark style="background-color:yellow;">XXX</mark>). A nice, round lecture hall suitable for 50-100 people. Just behind the ENSMM front desk/reception. JJ's favorite as it's easy to find for external people, and pleasing to address as a speaker
* Amphi Pierre Mesnage (room XXX). A somewhat older-looking lecture hall suitable for 50-100 people, similar to Jules Haag.&#x20;
* Amphi Emilie Du Chatelet (room <mark style="background-color:yellow;">XXX</mark>). A huge (400 people+) lecture hall that's typically only suitable for general assembly or conferences. In neighboring building _Bâtiment Tesla._&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As for rooms in Transfert building, ENSMM amphitheatre (Haag, Mesnage, Du Chatelet) cannot be booked by the FEMTO room reservation service, but by email to accueil@ens2m.fr&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Further away, but also useful:&#x20;

* Amphi Jean-Jacques Gagnepain, is a modern, fancy seminar room in the TEMIS Science building (Avenue des Montboucons, a 5 min. walk from ENSMM). Suitable for 50-70 people, commonly used for PhD defenses. Can be booked by FEMTO room reservation service.&#x20;

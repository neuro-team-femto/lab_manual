# Lab registration procedure

## Creating a FEMTO account

Your first step is to go and meet our two department administrators Isabelle GABET and Estelle PETITE (office <mark style="background-color:yellow;">XXX</mark>), who will manually input your information into our local FEMTO information system (called Uniweb).&#x20;

If being asked what team (équipe) you're part of, either mention JJ or team "DATA-PHM" (read about difference between group, team, dept, here: )

This step will issue you a personal account on the FEMTO web-services (in the form firstname.name@femto-st.fr). More precisely, Isabelle and Estelle will issue you a temporary account password, which you then have to activate/replace with your own preferred password by connecting to [https://uniweb2.femto-st.fr](https://uniweb2.femto-st.fr/). &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This step needs to be done on the local network, so either use eduroam wifi if you have, or ask someone to do it on their own computer.
{% endhint %}

Your finalized account will typically take about 24hours to propagate through the system to access all web services, but for testing purposes [https://cloud.femto-st.fr](https://cloud.femto-st.fr) should work immediately <mark style="background-color:yellow;">(Double-Check if correct)</mark>.&#x20;

## Obtain an ENSMM or UFC email account

The default Uniweb registration will not typically issue you additional access to the Supmicrotech/ENSMM or UFC (Université de Franche-Comté) webservices but depending on your status, you may be able to get that (and you should).

ENSMM web account (in the form first name initials + first 6 letters of family name, ex. jjaucout@ens2m.fr) will get you access to the eduroam WIFI (which is considered a local network for access to e.g. restricted FEMTO webservices), the ENSMM web services (https://ent.ens2m.fr, ENT for _Espace Numérique de Travail_) and the possibility to log on any ENSMM computer labs (which is important for running some of our experiments, see <mark style="background-color:yellow;">page</mark>).

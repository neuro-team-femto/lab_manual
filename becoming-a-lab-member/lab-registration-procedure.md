# FEMTO registration procedure

## Get a FEMTO account

Your first step is to go and meet our two department administrators Isabelle GABET and Estelle PETITE (office <mark style="background-color:yellow;">XXX</mark>), who will manually input your information into our local FEMTO information system (called Uniweb).

If being asked what team (équipe) you're part of, either mention JJ or team "DATA-PHM" (read about difference between group, team, dept, here: )

This step will issue you a personal account on the FEMTO web-services (in the form firstname.name@femto-st.fr). More precisely, Isabelle and Estelle will issue you a temporary account password, which you then have to activate/replace with your own preferred password by connecting to [https://uniweb2.femto-st.fr](https://uniweb2.femto-st.fr/).

{% hint style="info" %}
This step needs to be done on the local network, so either use eduroam wifi if you have, or ask someone to do it on their own computer.
{% endhint %}

Your finalized account will typically take about 24hours to propagate through the system to access all web services, but for testing purposes [https://cloud.femto-st.fr](https://cloud.femto-st.fr) should work immediately <mark style="background-color:yellow;">(Double-Check if correct)</mark>.

## Get a CNRS (Janus) account

If you're a CNRS employee (as most of us in the lab are), you will need a CNRS id to access important CNRS web services for e.g. handling vacation, travel to conferences, receive monthly records of your salary, etc.&#x20;

By default, your FEMTO/uniweb registration should trigger your registration to CNRS within a week. This step is done by staff at the Délégation Régionale CNRS in Nancy (see [about-our-operating-institutions.md](../about-the-lab/about-our-operating-institutions.md "mention") ). Your cnrs id will be your @femto-st.fr email and password.&#x20;

You can test that your account is working on janus.cnrs.fr, or any of the CNRS web services directly. If you don't get a working janus account within 1 week, please ask Isabelle or Estelle to enquire.&#x20;

## Get an ENSMM account

By default, your FEMTO/uniweb registration should also trigger an email giving you access to the ENSMM web services, to be received on your newly created @femto-st.fr email. If you don't receive this email for any reason, you can go to the ENSMM Service Informatique (in Bâtiment Transfert, close to the Transfert#é meeting room, room 0.73.16) and they will set it up for you.&#x20;

Your ENSMM web account (in the form first name initials + first 6 letters of family name, ex. jjaucout@ens2m.fr) will get you access to both the eduroam WIFI (which is considered a local network for access to e.g. restricted FEMTO webservices) and the ENSMM\_Personnel WIFI, the ENSMM web services (https://ent.ens2m.fr, ENT for _Espace Numérique de Travail_) and the possibility to log on any ENSMM computer labs (which is important for running some of our experiments, see <mark style="background-color:yellow;">page</mark>).

{% hint style="info" %}
The reason you can't use your FEMTO account to log in eduroam is that eduroam only works with/for degree granting higher-education institutions. FEMTO is a lab, and not a university. ENSMM and Université de Franche-Comté (UFC) both are, and so both can be used with eduroam.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Get a UFC email account

Registering to uniweb will _not_ issue you a UFC (Université de Franche-Comté) web account. This has to be done separately.&#x20;

If you're a PhD student registered at UFC (via ADUM), then you will be automatically issued a UFC account (in the firstname.name@univ-fcomte.fr) when you pay your registration fees (along with your student card). If you're not a UFC student (e.g. postdoc or contract employee not employed by UFC), then you have to make a separate request. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Add procedure.</mark>&#x20;

A UFC web account gets you address to the UFC webmail, UFC web portal ([https://ent.univ-fcomte.fr](https://ent.univ-fcomte.fr)) and, importantly, to the VPN allowing you to address FEMTO web services remotely.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting up a VPN account needs a request to the FEMTO computer services (Service Commun Informatique) - which you can only contact by a ticket service ([tickets.femto-st.fr](https://tickets.femto-st.fr/)). This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem if you're not on campus, as the ticket service can only be accessed if you're on the local network or... by VPN. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Get a key and access card

Upon registration, please inform our two admins Isabelle and Estelle that you'll be working in room 0.60.20 ("Neuro lab"), and that you'll need a key for this door, as well as door 0.60.21.&#x20;

You also need an access card to enter either the ENSMM front entrance, or the AS2M back door (in the space between the main hall and the Transfert building). When you arrive, you'll typically be given a temporary guest card (ask for it), but you'll need to make sure you enter the process of being issued a permanent card (called Pass'UBFC, with an ID picture).&#x20;

If you're a UFC student (eg. new PhD student), you will be issued your card automatically by UFC upon your PhD registration. If you're not a UFC employee, ask Isabelle or Estelle to apply for a card, and give them an ID picture. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Double-check correct procedure</mark>

When you receive your card (you may receive a notification on your UFC webmail, if any), it should be set up with the correct building access (ENSMM). If it is not the case, and the card doesn't work, you need to ask the ENSMM front desk to configure it correctly (there are update terminals in the ENSMM Hall where you can tag your card). <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Double-check procedure for getting card setup properly</mark>&#x20;

# Roles and expectations


## Big Picture

Science is hard. But it’s also fun. In the Neuro group Lab, we want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding lab environment. To maintain that environment, we expect each other to: 

- **Do work we are proud of individually and as a group**: Work on what you’re passionate about, work hard at it, and be proud of it. Be so proud of it that you have to suppress giggling when you think about it (but it’s ok to giggle a little).

- **Double-check our work, and be at least a little obsessive.**: Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. It’s ok to makes mistakes, but mistakes shouldn’t be because of carelessness or rushed work. One useful rule of thumb is "do I understand this at 130%" ? 

- **Be supportive - we're all in this together:** Support your fellow lab-mates. Help them out if they need help (even if you aren’t on the project), and let them vent when they need to. Science is collaborative, not competitive. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it. In your own work, be independent when possible, but do ask for help when necessary.

- **Be honest in your science**: We all want to get papers published and do great things. But we do this honestly. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. If you make a mistake, you should immediately tell your collaborators (if they have already seen the results, and especially if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.

- **Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.** Respect your fellow lab-mates. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their differences, their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation.

- **Keep everything awesome:** If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. We can’t thrive in an environment we aren’t comfortable in, and disrespect or rudeness will not be tolerated in the lab. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell JJ. In any case, tell JJ. If you have a problem with JJ and are comfortable telling him about it, do! If you aren’t comfortable, then tell a senior member of the group (for smaller issues) or another member of the  department (for more serious issues).

- **Care your for health and happiness**: Realize that for most of us, there are times for pulling all nighters, and times for leaving early to go to the park and enjoy the sunshine. If you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell JJ!). Your health and happiness come first. The lab looks out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help. It’s ok to go through hard patches (we all do), but you shouldn’t feel shy about asking for help or just venting. 


## Small Picture

There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to keep the lab running smoothly.

- If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick. If you’re sick, reschedule your meetings and participants for the day (or the next couple of days) as soon as you can. See a doctor and follow the procedure to report sick leave. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Link to corresponding section</mark>

- By default, you are expected to the lab at the normal working hours every working day. You do not have to be in 9:30am-5:30pm every day but do show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done. Show up to your meetings, show up to run your participants, and show up to lab meetings. Show up for your work, and show up for each other too. 

- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. 

- If you're not in the lab any given day, you'll be assumed to be in one of four possible "states": (1) in annual leave/holiday, (2) in sick leave (or, by extension maternity/paternity leave or compassionate absence), (3) in official travel (mission), or (4) in official remote-work (teletravail). In all instances, you are expected to report which is the case, both to your PI (typically a DM on Slack) and using your employer's absence reporting system. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Link to corresponding section</mark> 

- Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you’re the last one leaving for the day. 

- Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.

- Dress code is casual but not too casual. When interacting with participants or presenting your work, don’t wear pajamas and sweat pants – but jeans are totally fine.

- Be on time. Especially when you are running participants – in fact, show up 15-20 minutes early to set everything up. And be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.


## PhD Students 

All of the above (!), and you will also be expected to: 

- Know the literature related to their topic like the back of their hand. Stay up to date on the latest research, by using RSS feeds and/or getting journal table of contents. Also consider following scientists in the field on Twitter. By the second-year of PhD, you are expected to know *more* about your specific topic than your PI (more about the algorithms, about your data and results, about the people who work in the field, etc.)

- Develop your dissertation research. Typically, your dissertation should have at least 3 substantial experiments that answer a big-picture question that you have. 

- Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences

- Think about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, science writing, something else), and talk to your PI about it to make sure you’re getting the training you need for that career. 

- Make sure you meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for comité de suivi individuel de thèse) -- and make sure your PI is aware of them!

- Prioritize time for research. TAing or science communication are important, but ultimately your research gets you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career.

- By the time you’re done, you will have to know how to do statistics and plots in Python, to use tools like pandas, seaborn, pingouin or pymer proficiently, to share your work with others using git/github, to write an experiment using psychopy, to make figures and posters using powerpoint/adobe illustrator or similar graphic programs. The learning curve can be a little steep on these but it’s well worth it. (If these aren’t compatible with your goals or interests, the lab is probably not a good fit for you!)

## Post-Docs

All of the above, and you will also be expected to move towards being more PI-like, i.e. to: 

- Cultivate an independent research program (while still supporting the lab’s research)

- Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to

- Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences

- Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready. If you think you’d like to leave academia, that’s completely ok – but you should still treat your post-doc seriously, and talk to your PI about how to best train for a job outside academia

- Challenge your PI when he/she’s wrong or when your opinion is different, and treat the rest of the lab to your unique expertise 


## Principal Investigator

All of the above (!), and you can expect your PI to : 

- Have a vision of where the lab is going.

- Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else

- Make the time to meet with you regularly, read through your manuscripts, and talk about science.

- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit

- Seek out research funding to keep our activities viable

- Obsess a little about your Python code, your open-science practices and the graphic design of your figures

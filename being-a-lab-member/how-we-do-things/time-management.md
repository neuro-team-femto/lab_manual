# Time management

## Annual structure&#x20;

Because FEMTO-ST is a non-teaching environment, and most of us in the team are full-time researchers, a year in the lab isn't typically structured in terms/semesters (as many labs in other countries are).&#x20;

Our typical year starts in the last week of August, and lasts until mid-July. We keep our activity and lab meetings throughout the year, except during Christmas break (last 2 weeks of December), summer break (typically mid-July to end-August), and the occasional bank holiday.&#x20;

There are 11 official bank holiday (_jour férié_) in France, on which the lab is closed and lab members are not expected to come to work (even though the premises may remain open for urgent matters - double check if you intend to come in on these days):&#x20;

* New year's day (Jan 1st)
* Easter monday (one monday in April)
* Labour day (May 1st)
* Victory in Europe day (May 8th)
* Ascension day (one thursday in May)
* Whit Monday / Pentecôte (one monday in May)
* Bastille's day (July 14th)
* Assumption of Mary (Aug 15th)
* All saints' day (Nov 1st)
* Armistice day (Nov 11th)
* Christmas' day (dec 25th)

The lab has no mandatory vacation time, but our building closes down for one week every Christmas, and for 2 weeks in the first 2 weeks of August, so these are good times to plan vacations if you have any. If you want to keep working during these periods, you need to make arrangement to work from home.&#x20;

Because several faculty in the Dept. teach at ENSMM/Supmicrotech, and the ENSMM school year tends to align with the national school holidays (_vacances scolaires:_ vacances de Toussaint, 2 weeks end of October; vacances de Noel, 2 weeks end of Dec; vacances d'hiver, 2 weeks mid-February; vacances de Pâques/printemps, 2 weeks mid-April), you'll see the Dept. tend to get a little quiet on these periods. While many of us (incl. those with families) tend to align their own vacations with these periods, the lab will continue its normal operations throughout, albeit with maybe slightly less people around.&#x20;

## Absences/holidays

#### General rules

The rule in the lab is that, on any given day, every lab member is:&#x20;

Either at work, in the lab, during normal working hours

Or, if not in the lab, in one of 4 "absent states" that each need to be systematically reported:&#x20;

1. in holiday
2. in sick leave (or by extension maternity leave/compassionate leave)
3. in official travel (_mission_)
4. or in teletravail

Every absent state (holiday, sick leave, mission, teletravail) has to be reported at two places:&#x20;

1. to your PI, typically via a Slack DM, with reasonable advance notice whenever possible, and&#x20;
2. if you're a CNRS employee, in the CNRS AGATE-TEMPO plateform [https://agate-tempo.cnrs.fr](https://agate-tempo.cnrs.fr/fr/). (N.B. you need a CNRS/Janus id for this, which you only have if you're employed by CNRS. Other employers may have different plateforms)

Note that declaring your holiday in AGATE-TEMPO needs to be done _ahead_ of time, as they require validation by someone higher up (typically the head of dept) and they cannot be declared after the day is passed

#### &#x20;Annual leave/holiday

Your exact count of days of annual leave depends on your individual contract and employer but, in CNRS, it tends to be relatively high (8 weeks, or 40 days). How you use these days is up to you, but you have to inform your PI of when you take holidays with a reasonable notice (ex. rule of x4-6: one week ahead for one day, one month ahead for a week off, 4-6 months ahead for a month off) to help with project planning and lab organization.&#x20;

It is okay to take most of your annual leave at once, which may make sense e.g. if visiting family abroad.&#x20;

The lab has no mandatory vacation time, but our building closes down for one week every Christmas, and for 2 weeks in the first 2 weeks of August, so these are good times to plan vacations if you have any.

#### Sick leave guidelines

If you're too sick to come to work, (1) inform your PI (typically via a Slack DM), (2) visit a doctor (GP, _médecin généraliste_) and ask for a sick leave certificate. You can then declare your sick leave on the CNRS HR plateform [https://ariane.cnrs.fr](https://ariane.cnrs.fr)

#### Maternity/paternity leave

## Lab hours

* Lab hours \[when to be in the lab for different roles; when is the lab room open]



* Weekly/regular meetings \[time, place, purpose, journal club readings + link to schedule]
* Dealing with deadlines \[how to plan the completion of deadlines, how to deal with delays]
* In-lab and remote working norms \[when are members expected to work in the lab or how can they work from home]
* Calendar usage \[who to share your calendar with, what to put in your calendar]
* Social and special events \[if lab dinners/excursions/team-building/etc. is a part of lab life, or if it isn’t, mention it here, social events]

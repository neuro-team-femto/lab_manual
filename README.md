Welcome!&#x20;

This document is the lab manual for the FEMTO Neuro Group ("the lab"). Its purpose is to gather basic information about the lab and the procedures we follow.&#x20;

It not only serves as a first point of reference for new lab members who join the group, but also, for everyone, to document the common conventions and procedures that we have established and also be a basis to propose and implement improvements to this workflow as new, better methods become available.&#x20;

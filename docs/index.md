Welcome!

This document is the lab manual for the [FEMTO Neuro Group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io) (hereafter "the lab"), a research group of the Dept. of Automation and Robotics, FEMTO-ST Institute in Besan√ßon, France. 

The purpose of this manual is to gather basic information about the lab and the procedures we follow. It not only intended as a first point of reference for new lab members who join the group, but also, for everyone, to document the common conventions and procedures that we have established and to be a basis to propose improvements to this workflow as new, better methods become available.

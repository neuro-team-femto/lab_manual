# Manual metadata

This manual was created by JJ Aucouturier in Sept. 2023, and is since then receiving contributions from several lab members. 

The manual was inspired by other [similar works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqGdtHg0dMbj9lsCnC1QOoWzIsnSNRTSek6i3Kls2Ik/edit). In some places, we have adapted or reproduced content from the [Peelle lab](http://jpeelle.net/peellelab_manual.pdf), [Aly lab](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and Sam Mehr's [Music Lab](https://handbook-public.themusiclab.org/) manuals, and we thank them for that. 

This manual is written in the [materials for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) framework (Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2023 Martin Donath).

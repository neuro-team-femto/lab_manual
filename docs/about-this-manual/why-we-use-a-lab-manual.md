# Why we use a lab manual

The purpose of this manual is to gather basic information about the lab and the procedures we follow. 

One benefit for this document is to act as collective wisdom on how to run and administer the many aspects of being a member of the lab. This includes learning to navigate the local academic environment, guiding what registration(s) one needs to do on their first day/week, using the lab's computer services and more generally documenting how we do things re: our internal communication, meetings, time management, etc. It not only intended as a first point of reference for new lab members who join the group, but also, for everyone, to document the common conventions and procedures that we have established and to be a basis to propose improvements to this workflow as new, better methods become available.

Another benefit of this document is to clarify our roles and expectations. We are an interdisciplinary, multicultural team with a big variety of backgrounds and academic experience, and it is sometimes unclear what is generally expected of a member in a lab such as ours, as well as what one can expect from the PI. This document is intended to represent the PI's vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing FEMTO-ST, CNRS and University policies (which take precedence). 

Upon joining the lab, all lab members are required to read the lab manual. We expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, see [this page](how-to-update-the-manual.md)

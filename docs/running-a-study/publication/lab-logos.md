### FEMTO-ST Logo

The standard [FEMTO-ST logo]((https://extranet.femto-st.fr/intranet/comm/Logos/Forms/Thumbnails.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fintranet%2Fcomm%2FLogos%2FFEMTO%2DST&FolderCTID=0x012000233A16033461A44FB4F0399B3527FCDA&View=%7BE0648792%2D6BE5%2D452B%2DA8AE%2D4F6A9A2EA958%7D)) is on the intranet space for [Service Commun Communication](https://extranet.femto-st.fr/intranet/comm). 

Note that while we're in 2024, we're instructed to use the special ["20th anniversary" version](https://extranet.femto-st.fr/intranet/comm/Logos/Forms/Thumbnails.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fintranet%2Fcomm%2FLogos%2FFEMTO%2DST%2FLogo%20FEMTO%2DST%2020%20ans&FolderCTID=0x012000233A16033461A44FB4F0399B3527FCDA&View=%7BE0648792%2D6BE5%2D452B%2DA8AE%2D4F6A9A2EA958%7D) of that logo. 

### Tutelles (Operating institutions)

Until 2024, logos for our tutelles were a simple [CNRS](https://extranet.femto-st.fr/intranet/comm/Logos/Forms/Thumbnails.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fintranet%2Fcomm%2FLogos%2Flogos%20tutelles%2FCNRS&FolderCTID=0x012000233A16033461A44FB4F0399B3527FCDA&View=%7BE0648792%2D6BE5%2D452B%2DA8AE%2D4F6A9A2EA958%7D) + [UBFC](https://extranet.femto-st.fr/intranet/comm/Logos/Forms/Thumbnails.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fintranet%2Fcomm%2FLogos%2Flogo%20divers%2FUBFC&FolderCTID=0x012000233A16033461A44FB4F0399B3527FCDA&View=%7BE0648792%2D6BE5%2D452B%2DA8AE%2D4F6A9A2EA958%7D). 

In Jan. 2025, UBFC doesn't exist anymore and has been replaced by EPE Université Marie et Louis Pasteur, for which no logo exists yet (as of Dec. 2024). Logos for our tutelles should therefore include CNRS, UFC and SUPMICROTECH. They're [here](https://extranet.femto-st.fr/intranet/comm/Logos/Forms/Thumbnails.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fintranet%2Fcomm%2FLogos%2Flogos%20tutelles&FolderCTID=0x012000233A16033461A44FB4F0399B3527FCDA&View=%7BE0648792%2D6BE5%2D452B%2DA8AE%2D4F6A9A2EA958%7D)

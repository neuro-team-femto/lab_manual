# Communication

### Slack & work-life balance&#x20;

Because we don't use email for internal communication among lab members, we tend to use Slack as both a synchronous (e.g. to chat in real-time) and asynchronous (e.g. post an idea, a request, share a paper...) means of communication. This means that you'll see slack messages being posted at pretty much any time, including by PIs. Except in case of clear emergency (which will be clearly indicated by your PI), please don't take this as an injonction to answer outside of normal working hours - you can if you like, but you are not expected to.&#x20;

This is especially true if you use Slack on your personal mobile phone. Installing the Slack app can be convenient (logging the occasional the late-night idea, answering to someone on a deadline, communicating while traveling to a conference, etc.), but if you do so please pay attention to your work/life balance, and to everybody else's.&#x20;

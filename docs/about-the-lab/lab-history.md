# Lab history

## The FEMTO Neuro Group (2021\~)

The neuro group was established in the FEMTO-ST Institute by PIs JJ Aucouturier and Patrick Nectoux in Jan. 2021. The group moved from its previous installment as the [CREAM music neuroscience team](http://cream.ircam.fr/) (2014-2020) at the [Science and Technology of Music and Sound Lab](https://www.stms-lab.fr/) (STMS, IRCAM/CNRS/Sorbonne Université) in [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/), Paris, France.&#x20;



## The CREAM team (2014-2020)

The CREAM team was originally funded by an ERC Starting Grant (Cracking the Emotional Code of Music - 335536, PI: JJ Aucouturier) and has then received subsequent funding by ANR REFLETS (2017-2021) and Fondation pour l’Audition ([Prix d’Emergence scientifique 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toHbRQMHB-w)).

The research vision of the CREAM team was to bridge over the two disciplines of audio signal processing and cognitive neuroscience/psychology, and turn voice and music into cognitive technologies, with algorithms to create sounds able to selectively activate certain neural pathways, or certain emotions. To this aim, the project introduced several novel methodologies to study the effect of sound on the brain, in the form of acoustic transformation software (SMILE; [DAVID](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/david), 2800 downloads as of Jan 2021; [CLEESE](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/cleese), 950 downloads; [ANGUS](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/angus), 1200 downloads). These technologies formed the basis of experimental research articles notably published in PNAS ([2016](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/948); [2018](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3972)), Current Biology ([2018](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(18\)30752-8); [2021](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(21\)01195-7)) and Nature Communications ([2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20649-4)).

Over the course of the project (2014-2020), the CREAM team employed more than 15 PhD-level scientists, roughly half of them coming from a computer science or audio engineering background, and the other half from a psychology or cognitive neuroscience background - a diverse, amazing crew of young scientists which have since the end of the project moved on, several of them to start their own independent positions. Beyond academia, the software technologies produced in the project have also been transfered to the voice technology startup [Alta Voce](http://alta-voce.tech), which is now testing the impact of real-time voice transformation in the field of customer relation.

The CREAM team/project ended in December 2020. This page [https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/cream/](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/cream/) archives the team’s key publications, team members and where each of these people went. The legacy of the CREAM team continues at the FEMTO-ST Neuro group, which was established in the FEMTO-ST Institute in Jan. 2021 on the basis of some of project CREAM’s key findings in [psychophysical reverse-correlation](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3972) and [vocal feedback](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/948).

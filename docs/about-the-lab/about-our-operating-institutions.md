# About our operating institutions

## The concept of _unité mixte de recherche_ 

The [FEMTO Neuro Group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io) is a research group of the [Dept. of Automation and Robotics](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Presentation), which itself is one of the 7 Departments of the [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr/en). 

The FEMTO-ST Institute is our main administrative entity, which is in French academic lingua called a [_unité mite de recherche_](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit%C3%A9_mixte_de_recherche) (UMR) or, informally, _laboratoire_. There are about 800 different UMRs in France, which all have a name and number. The FEMTO-ST Institute is UMR 6174.  

The reason UMRs are called _"mixed"_ is that they are typically co-operated by several different institutions. In our case, the FEMTO-ST Institute is co-operated by [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique](https://www.cnrs.fr) (CNRS), [Université de Franche-Comté](https://www.univ-fcomte.fr/)(UFC), l'[Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques](https://www.supmicrotech.fr)(SUPMICROTECH) and l'[Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr) (UTBM). In French, such co-operating institutions are called the _tutelles_ (or _co-tutelles_) of the UMR. 

<mark> Update: </mark> As of Jan. 2025, Université de Franche-Comté, SUPMICROTECH and UTBM have joined team, as well as a number of other local academic institutions, in a new federated university called [Université Marie et Louis Pasteur](https://www.umlp.fr/), called after Louis Pasteur (who was born in [Arbois](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbois) and educated in Besançon) and his wife [Marie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Pasteur) who recently gained recognition as a collaborator.

## Getting stuff done in UMRs

It is important to understand that, while UMRs are the main building blocks of French academia, they are purely administrative units which have no financial or legal existence: UMRs cannot hire personnel, issue contracts, invoice or get paid by other entities, nor be held responsible legally. All of these operations rather involve the _tutelles_ of the UMRs. In practice, this means that nobody in the lab are employees of the FEMTO-ST Institute (which has no legal right to employ anyone), but can only be employed by one of its tutelles (CNRS, UMLP, SUPMICROTECH or UTBM). Similarly, our research budget is never hosted at FEMTO-ST: it resides in budget lines in either CNRS, UMLP, SUPMICROTECH or UTBM. Whenever we sign a contract, research or internship agreement, the signatory is not FEMTO-ST, but again one of CNRS, UMLP, SUPMICROTECH or UTBM. 

This has several consequences in practice: 

- you could find yourself in a room where 4 people work together on a research project, and all rightful members of the FEMTO-ST Institute, despite being employed by four different institutions (ex. one may be a _chargé de recherche_ CNRS, another a _maître de conférence_ SUPMICROTECH) - confusingly often with different job titles and even different pay scales (also most of these have been largely uniformized in recent years, a trend perhaps driven by this UMR organization).

- administrative rules as to e.g. where and how to buy stuff, how to handle research budget, travel costs, etc. are all tutelle-dependant, and may therefore differ based on where the corresponding budget is handled. For instance, while it may be impossible to buy a computer at the local shop in research budget handled at CNRS (because e.g. CNRS has a country-wide agreement to only use a designed seller), it may be possible to do so if your research budget is handled at e.g. SUPMICROTECH (which may not have such a requirement). 

- depending on the tutelle in charge, some of the admin services handling your research procedures may be on-site (ex. administrative services for SUPMICROTECH are in the same building), others in other parts of the campus (e.g. UMLP), others in other parts of the country. For instance, CNRS procedures from the lab are all handled regionally, in the [_Délégation Régionale Centre-Est_](https://www.centre-est.cnrs.fr) in Nancy, but luckily involve a lot of remote/web services (see [list](../../becoming-a-lab-member/femto-st-web-services) here). 

While this sounds complicated, there are several advantages to such an organization: 

- all UMR personnel, regardless of which tutelle is their employer, are entitled to services by all the other tutelles. In our case, this is reflected in how e.g. our group occupies lab space in the SUPMICROTECH building (despite most of us being employed by CNRS) without needing to e.g. rent space as is sometimes seen in ango-saxon academia; and how upon joining the lab one has access to web accounts and services operated by all tutelles (see [lab registration procedure](../../becoming-a-lab-member/lab-registration-procedure) here).

- our heroic department admins (Isabelle Gabet and Estelle Petite) act a one-stop shop to interface with all tutelle services, and most insulate us from all this complexity. For most of our administrative processes they will typically be the only persons you get to talk to, and they will relay the request (or, sometimes, direct you) to the person in charge in the central services of whatever tutelle is involved. 

!!! Note 
	In case of CNRS procedures, Isabelle and Estelle will relay the request (or direct you) to the regional CNRS services of [_Délégation Régionale Centre-Est_](https://www.centre-est.cnrs.fr) in Nancy. As a rule of thumb, every request should first go to Isabelle and Estelle, never directly to staff at Délégation Régionale (who typically manage a portfolio of 10-20 labs each, including FEMTO-ST). In the rare cases where you need to interact to someone in Nancy, Isabelle or Estelle will let you know exactly whom to contact and how.  

All this still means one has to mentally juggle the different opportunities and constraints entailed by managing work in one or another tutelle. In practice, because both Neuro group PIs JJA and PN are formally CNRS employees, we tend to manage most, if not all, of our research procedures so that they are handled by CNRS. This means that typical lab members will be hired by CNRS (i.e. CNRS is signatory on their work contract), and our typical expenses and travel will be paid from grant money that's managed by CNRS. Much of the procedures described in this manual therefore correspond to CNRS practices, and may not apply to e.g. other teams in the department or the institute who may be operated with other preferred tutelles.

## About our CNRS tutelle

The [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://www.cnrs.fr) (French: Centre national de la recherche scientifique, CNRS) is the largest French state research organisation (formally, an _Établissement public à caractère scientifique et technologique_, or EPST) and the largest fundamental science agency in Europe. 

It employs more than 30,000 staff, including ca. 12,000 tenured researchers, 13,000 engineers and technical staff, and 8,000 contractual workers. It is headquartered in Paris (rue Michel Ange, 75016). 

The CNRS operates on the basis of "joint research units" (UMRs – French: Unité mixte de recherche) that are run in association with other institutions, such as universities. 

### Organization
The CNRS executive agency is divided into 10 thematic "institutes", which affiliate a portfolio of ca. 50-100 research units (or "labs"). CNRS Institutes include e.g. the Institute of Physics (INP), Institute of Biological Sciences (INSB), Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences (INSHS) or the Institute for Computer Sciences (INS2I). Every UMR (or "lab") is affiliated with at least one CNRS Institute. The CNRS Institute in charge of FEMTO-ST is the [Institute for Engineering and Systems Sciences](https://www.insis.cnrs.fr) (INSIS)

!!! Warning "Institutes and institutes"
	The word "Institute" is yet another of these confusing words: the FEMTO-ST _Institute_ is said to be affiliated with the CNRS _Institute_ for for Engineering and Systems Sciences, but these 2 words do not refer to the same thing. The "FEMTO-ST Institute" is the name of UMR6174 - it's formally a lab, using the word "Institute" just to hint at the fact that it's large. CNRS "Institutes" such as INSIS are not labs, and do not conduct any research. Rather, they are the executive arm of CNRS that manages a portfolio of labs (some of them calling themselves "Institutes", as do FEMTO-ST).  

Another important entity within CNRS is the [National Committee for Scientific Research](https://www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/) (CoNRS), which functions a bit like a democratic assembly, and is composed of elected and nominated researchers from CNRS UMRs across the country. CoNRS is divided into thematic sections (e.g. section 7 (renumbered 3 as of 2025) is computer science and control, section 26 is neuroscience, and so on). It is in charge of the recruitment and evaluaton of permanent CNRS researchers, and also advises the executive CNRS Institutes about questions linked to research strategy and science policy.  

!!! Note 
	CoNRS is in charge of the recruitment and evaluation of permanent CNRS researchers, who are recruited via a yearly call, or "concours". If you're a postdoc looking for a permanent research position in France, you may need to learn more about this system (ask your PI). There is notoriously little English-language information about the application process, but these blog posts [[1]](https://a3nm.net/work/applications/), [[2]](https://discrete-notes.github.io/CNRS-application), [[3]](https://games-automata-play.github.io/blog/applying_cnrs/) cover some of it. 

!!! Note 
	As a CNRS reseacher, PI JJA is himself continuously evaluated by CoNRS (namely, section 7). We have a yearly report called CRAC (compte-rendu d'activité chercheur), which is mostly admin (a web form), but also more detailed reports every 5 (2.5 year) and 10 semesters (5 year), called rapports à vague et à mi-vague. These are more involved (the order of 25 pages for mi-vague, and 50 pages for vague), and get formally reviewed, with a one-page commentary, which may then influence promotion decisions, etc. but mostly serve as useful feedback by peers. It's a useful system. If you're interested, [here](../../downloads/dossier_03_09_2025.pdf) is a copy of JJA's mi-vague report, covering the period from Oct. 2022 to July 2025, submitted for evaluation in Sept. 2025. 


Finally, for administrative purposes, the CNRS is divided into 18 regional divisions, called _Délégations_. Each Délégation handles HR, finance and administrative operations for a portfolio of labs/UMR located in the area (regardless of which CNRS Institute they may be affiliated with). The CNRS Délégation Régionale operating the FEMTO-ST Institute [_Délégation Régionale Centre-Est_](https://www.centre-est.cnrs.fr) in Vandoeuvre (near Nancy). 


### CNRS employment status

Researchers who are permanent employees of the CNRS are equivalent to lifelong research fellows in English-speaking countries. CNRS researchers are hired at two ranks: scientist (_chargé.e de recherche_ or CR, the equivalent of Assistant/Associate Professor) and senior scientist (_directeur/rice de recherche_ or DR, equ. Associate/Full Professor). In principle, research directors tend to head research groups, but this is not a general rule (a research scientist can head a group or even a laboratory and some research directors do not head a group). 

!!! Note
	While UK/US academia typically has 3 ranks (lecturer/assistant professor, reader/associate professor, full professor), with only the latter 2 being associated with tenure/permanent positions, the French system typically has two ranks, and is tenured from the start. In CNRS, these ranks are called chargé.e de recherche (CR) and directeur/rice de recherche (DR); the equivalent rank in French universities and _grandes écoles_ are maître.sse de conférence (MCU), and professeur.e (PU).  

Employees for support activities (called ITA, for _ingénieur.e.s, technicien.ne.s, administratif.ve.s_) include research engineers (_ingénieur.e de recherche_), study engineers (_ingénieur.e d'études_), assistant engineers (_assistant.e ingénieur.e_) and technicians. Contrary to what the name would seem to imply, these may have administrative duties (e.g. the administrative manager of a laboratory may be an "assistant engineer", even though they don't typically hold an engineering degree).

Neuro group PIs JJA and PN are both tenured CNRS employees. JJA is _directeur de recherche_ and PN is _ingénieur de recherche_. 

All CNRS employees have the status of civil servants and are part of the public service (see also [open science](../lab-philosophy-values/#open-science)). 

## About our other tutelles

### Université Marie et Louis Pasteur (UMLP) / ex- Université de Franche-Comté (UFC)

The [University of Franche-Comté](https://www.univ-fcomte.fr/) (UFC) is a public French university located in Besançon, Franche-Comté, with decentralized campuses in Belfort, Montbéliard, Vesoul and Lons-le-Saunier. 

UFC enrolls about 30,000 students, including nearly a third of scholarship students and about 15% foreign students. It is the host of 28 research labs, 667 PhD students and 788 research faculty. 

The university was founded in 1423 in Dole, at that time in the Duchy of Burgundy. It was moved to Besançon in 1691 as Dole was being punished for having resisted too long against the king of France Louis XIV during his conquest of the region.

As of Jan. 2025, Université de Franche-Comté, SUPMICROTECH and UTBM have joined team, as well as a number of other local academic institutions, in a new federated university called [Université Marie et Louis Pasteur](https://www.umlp.fr/), which is now the official name of UFC. 

### What's the business with Université de Bourgogne Franche Comté ? 

From 2022-2025, UFC and neighboring Université de Bourgogne (UB) in Dijon made efforts towards creating a federated university called Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté (UBFC). For political reasons, UB left the merger in 2024, and UBFC was therefore [discontinued](https://journal-du-palais.fr/au-sommaire/collectivites/2025-le-reve-d-une-grande-universite-regionale-est-mort). As of 2025, UFC as well as other local institutions, but not UB, have created a new institution called Université Marie et Louis Pasteur. On its side, UB has formed another 'coalition' called Université Bourgogne Europe (UBE). 

You may find old documents refering to Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, but as of 2025, these should typically be updated to UMLP (waiting for the next political drama). There's a little bit of understandable fatigue about name changes: if you enrolled as a PhD student in 2022, you were supposed to receive a PhD from UFC for half of your first year, then were told your PhD would be granted by UBFC, and by the time of your defense you became a UMLP PhD. Let's hope that the new venture UMLP endures on. 

### SUPMICROTECH/ENSMM

The [École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques](https://www.supmicrotech.fr) (SUPMICROTECH, previously ENSMM) is a French _Grande Ecole_ of engineering. It is part of Polyméca, a network of schools focusing on mechanical engineering, and is located in Besançon. 

The school was founded in 1902 by the Université de Franche-Comté as _Laboratoire de Chronométrie_. In 1961, it turned to École nationale supérieure de chronométrie et micromécanique (ENSCM). Since the school is established in an area with a strong legacy on horology, ENSMM is deeply dedicated to the design and manufacturing of micro-mechanical devices and robotics.

The school enrolls about 250 students every year, and has a 3 year curriculum covering Materials science, mechatronics, optoelectronics and industrial engineering. Students graduate with the equivalent of a M.Eng.  

### UTBM

The [University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr) (UTBM) is, like SUPMICROTECH, a _Grande École_ of engineering located in Belfort, Sevenans and Montbéliard, France. UTBM is part of the network of the three "universities of technology", the other two being located in Compiegne and Troyes.
